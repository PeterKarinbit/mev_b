## 📊 Maximum Flash Loan Available

- **USDC:** 61,329 USDC (from Balancer vault)
- **WETH:** 26.94 ETH (~$94k)

**For $100k opportunities:**
- You can use up to $61k USDC from vault
- Or convert to WETH and use up to $94k

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **These profits are BEFORE slippage**
   - Large trades will have slippage
   - Actual profit may be lower

2. **Flash loans must be repaid in same transaction**
   - You can't hold for 7 days
   - These calculations assume you can capture yield instantly (unrealistic)
   - **Yield farming with flash loans is very difficult!**

3. **Most profitable opportunity:**
   - **WETH-USDC** with $289 profit/week
   - But TVL may be too low for $100k

4. **Reality check:**
   - Most opportunities need $500k+ to be truly profitable
   - With $61k max, profits are very small
   - Consider arbitrage instead (works better with smaller amounts)

## 💡 Recommendation

**For $100k+ flash loans, focus on:**
- **Arbitrage** (better profit margins)
- **Liquidations** (if you had a loan)
- **Token migrations** (one-time events)

**Yield farming with flash loans is challenging because:**
- You can't hold positions (must repay in same transaction)
- Need very large amounts to be profitable
- Slippage eats into profits
